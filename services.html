      Technology support, automation, and insight — delivered as a long-term digital partnership.

<!-- ================= Our Approach ================= -->
<section class="services">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>Our approach</h2>

    <p>
      At Knight Data & Automation, we don’t see ourselves as a subcontractor you only speak to
      when something breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work alongside businesses as a trusted digital partner — helping them use technology
      more effectively, reduce complexity, and build systems that support long-term growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything we deliver is designed to be practical, understandable, and aligned with how
      your business actually operates.
    </p>

<!-- ================= How We Work ================= -->
<section class="services">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>How we work</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Understand first</strong> —
        we take time to understand your processes, challenges, and goals before recommending anything.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Build on what you already have</strong> —
        wherever possible, we improve and extend existing tools rather than replacing them.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Keep it practical</strong> —
        systems are designed to be used daily, not admired once and forgotten.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Think long-term</strong> —
        decisions are made with scalability, sustainability, and future clarity in mind.
      </li>
    </ul>
