    <h1>Our services</h1>

    <p>
      Technology support, automation, and insight — delivered as a long-term
      digital partnership, not a transactional service.
    </p>

<!-- ================= APPROACH ================= -->
<section class="services-section">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>Our approach</h2>

    <p>
      At Knight Data & Automation, we don’t position ourselves as a subcontractor
      you only contact when something breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work alongside businesses as a trusted digital partner — helping simplify
      technology, reduce friction, and build systems that support sustainable,
      long-term growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything we deliver is designed to be practical, understandable, and aligned
      with how your business actually operates day to day.
    </p>

<!-- ================= HOW WE WORK ================= -->

  <div class="container">

    <h2>How we work</h2>

    <ul class="principles-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Understand first</strong> — we take time to understand your processes,
        challenges, and goals before recommending solutions.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Build on what you already have</strong> — wherever possible, we extend
        and improve existing tools rather than replacing them unnecessarily.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Keep it practical</strong> — systems are designed to be used daily,
        not admired once and forgotten.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Think long-term</strong> — decisions are made with scalability,
        sustainability, and future clarity in mind.
      </li>
    </ul>
