    <h1>Our services</h1>
    <p>
      Technology support, automation, and insight — delivered as a long-term digital partnership,
      not a transactional service.

    <!-- ---------- Our Approach ---------- -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our approach</h2>

      <p>
        At Knight Data & Automation, we don’t position ourselves as a subcontractor you only contact
        when something breaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        We work alongside businesses as a trusted digital partner — helping them simplify technology,
        reduce friction, and build systems that support sustainable, long-term growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything we deliver is designed to be practical, understandable,
        and aligned with how your business actually operates day to day.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ---------- How We Work ---------- -->
    <section>
      <h2>How we work</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Understand first</strong> —
          we take time to understand your processes, challenges, and goals before recommending solutions.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Build on what you already have</strong> —
          wherever possible, we improve and extend existing tools rather than replacing them unnecessarily.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Keep it practical</strong> —
          systems are designed to be used daily, not admired once and forgotten.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Think long-term</strong> —
          decisions are made with scalability, sustainability, and future clarity in mind.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
